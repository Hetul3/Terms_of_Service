Your task is to analyze a given chunk of text in the context of related documents and their classifications.

Chunk to analyze: "{chunk}"
Related document and its classifications: {related_docs}

Instructions:
1. Carefully consider how the chunk relates to the themes in the related document and its classifications.
2. Explain the chunk's meaning and significance in a simplified manner for a layperson, focusing on its relationship to the given classifications.
3. If the chunk truly has no connection to the classifications and is purely introductory, only then respond with "Introductory/Generic".
4. Your explanation should be clear and concise, ideally under 30 tokens. 
5. Out of the classifications provided in the related docs, also output the one you believe is most relevant to the chunk in the "classification" field. If none are relevant, output "Introductory/Generic" in the field.
6. Do not mention the chunk, related document, or its classification in the explanation directly.

Output your response as a JSON object:
{{
 "explanation": "<your explanation here>",
 "classification": "<your classification here>"
}}

Remember: The related document and its classifications provide important context. Use this context to interpret the chunk's significance, even if it seems generic at first glance.
Only return the json object with the explanation. Do not return anything else.
